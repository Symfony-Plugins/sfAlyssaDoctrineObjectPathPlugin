# sfAlyssaDoctrineObjectPathPlugin plugin #

## Introduction ##

This plugin adds ObjectPath support to Doctrine.

This syntax makes it very easy to do sorting and filtering on foreign fields. ObjectPaths are dot-seperated relation-names that relate from one object to another and this behavior translates the objectPaths to table-aliasses.

This plugin is based on the work of Leon van der Ree and your plugin
 [sfPropelObjectPathBehaviorPlugin](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfPropelObjectPathBehaviorPlugin).


## Installation

1.Download and install the plugin

    ./symfony plugin:install sfAlyssaSmsPlugin

2.Clear the cache

    ./symfony cc


## Example ##


So a very simple ObjectPath from City to Country is simply "Country" and from Country to City it would be "City":
In other words the relation-name.

However ObjectPaths support dots to 'jump' from object to object. So for example from Review to Book to Author would be "Book.Author".

In Php-code this shows up as:

    [php]
    $query = Doctrine_Query::create();
    $reviews = $query->
      joinByObjectPath('Book.Author')->
      orderByObjectPath('Book.Author.FirstName asc')->
      excecute();

to find all reviews, joined with their Books, joined with their Authors.

## Note ##

The sfAlyssaDoctrineObjectPathPlugin is used in the sfDataSourcePlugin, but not required.
